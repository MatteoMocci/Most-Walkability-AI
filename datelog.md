# Work Log for AI Walkability Assessment (MOST)

The goal of the project is to train AI models for the assessment of Walkability Labels. This project started in February 2024, and definetely needs some mantainance.
This particular repo is related to the AI backbone and the only focus is model training and result logging.
The novelty idea of this research is to use Satellite pictures for Walkability assessment joint to traditional Streetview pictures. 
Originally the idea was to use two transformers, one for each type of data source and then have a CNN give an evaluation based on what each model has learned.
The idea has evolved into using a Dual Encoder approach which embeds everything into a single model, each model is actually an image encoder which is trained to extract relevant features.
